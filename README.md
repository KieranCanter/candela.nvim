# Candela

regex highlighter. designed for efficient log analysis.

Inspired by the [Log
Analysis](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=XinyaYang0506.log-analysis) VSCode
extension. Couldn't find any plugins for tracking and highlighting lines based on multiple regexes
so I made this.

required:

* regex search tool ([ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep),
[ag](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher), [ugrep](https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep),
[ack](https://beyondgrep.com/install/), grep)
